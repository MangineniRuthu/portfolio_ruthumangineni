              Hi, I’m Ruthu Mangineni, a passionate Frontend Developer with over
              3 years of experience in creating responsive and user-friendly web
              applications. I specialize in JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, and
              Redux, focusing on writing clean and efficient code. I’m
              experienced in building seamless connections between the frontend
              and backend using RESTful APIs and optimizing application
              performance. With a strong background in Agile practices and CI/CD
              pipelines, I thrive in collaborative environments, delivering
              innovative solutions that meet user needs and exceed expectations.

                    <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
                    <p class="sub-para">Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid, 
                        where players take turns marking empty squares with either an "X" or an "O". 
                        The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, 
                        or diagonally. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game results in a tie. It is simple to learn, fast-paced, and often used to teach basic strategy and decision-making. 
                        While the game is easy to play, it can be challenging to master, especially when playing against a skilled opponent.</p>

                    <h2>Rock-Scissors-Paper</h2>
                    <p class="sub-para">Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple and fun two-player game often used to make decisions or settle disputes. Each player simultaneously chooses one of three gestures—rock, paper, or scissors.
                         The outcome is determined by the following rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. 
                         If both players choose the same gesture, it results in a tie. 
                         The game is quick to play, requires no equipment, and relies on both chance and strategy, making it a popular choice for all ages. Variations like "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" add extra gestures and complexity for more engaging gameplay.</p>
